Projeto de PA 


# Outline:
This project is meant to be integrated with the Pidesco project, which consists in a IDE developed by students of ISCTE-IUL.
The view I developped aims to display the opened class structure in a tree view that is easier for the user to interact.

# Outline Services:
In order for this plugin to be used by others there are several services that can be used and are available on an interface.

# Extention Point:
The component can be extended by other plugins, allowing them to give a string that they want to highlight on the outline tree.
